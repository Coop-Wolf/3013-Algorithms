### Description:

This program implements a linked list and includes a JSON object. The program begins
by reading in a list of animals and storing them into a JSON object. The user is then 
asked to enter keys. As soon as the user enters a valid character, the program will
tell inform the user how long it took to find those words and a list of ten animals 
will be printed to the screen that contain the string on characters the user entered. 
It will also print the numbers of animals that contain that string entered. To end the 
program, the user needs to type in 'Z'. This program was created to introduce me to
JSON and what it is capable of, coloring text, and using a timer.
