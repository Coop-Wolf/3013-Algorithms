## P01 - Vector Class
### Cooper Wolf
### Description:

This program includes a class that works like a vector. It has the ability to push and pop integers
to the front and rear of a vector, while also being able to read in arrays, input files, and other 
vectors into the container. This is a linked list based vector which makes it easier to push and pop
values in any given index of the vector. This program was created to reinforce my knowledge of linked
list based ADT's and to implement various operations that they can perform.
